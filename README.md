Abstract
This report is an analysis of global COVID figures as gathered by the World Health Organisation over the last three years. There was global outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions were particularly at risk of catching this disease. This resulted in mass stay at home orders being issued to decrease the number of cases while a vaccine was being created. To increase immunity to the disease, there was a global drive to vaccinate as much of the population as possible. I am going to analyse the figures of vaccinations and reported incidences of COVID-19 and deaths.
